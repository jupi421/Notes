# Liouville's theorem

Liouville's theorem states that the phase space density is conserved along a trajectory $\{\textbf{r}^N(t), \textbf{p}^N(t)\}$. This means
$$ 
    0 = \frac{d \rho}{d t} = \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \sum_{i=1}^N \left( \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial \textbf{r}_i} \dot{\textbf{r}}_i + \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial \textbf{p}_i} \dot{\textbf{p}}_i \right)
$$
where $\rho(t, \textbf{r}^N(t), \textbf{p}^N(t))$ is the phase space density.

**In other words:** If we have a volume in phase space and we let the system evolve in time, the region it occupies at a later time will be deformed but still have the same volume.
