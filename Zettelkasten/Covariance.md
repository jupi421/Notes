# Covariance

The covariance is a measure of the cross correlation of two random variables. It is computed like this:
$$ 
    C = \langle XY \rangle - \langle X \rangle \langle Y \rangle
$$
It has the properties:
1. If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $C(X, Y) = 0$
2. If $X$ and $Y$ are the same, then $C = \langle XX \rangle - \langle X \rangle \langle X \rangle
$ which is the variance of $X$.
The covariance of all cross correlations can be written as the covariance matrix, which is symmetric.

It is also used in the [[Zettelkasten/Multivariate_Gaussian|multivariate gaussian distribution]].
