# Correlation functions

In the general case where $\langle A \rangle \neq 0$ we're considering  the difference $\Delta A(t) = A(t) - \langle A \rangle$ time-correlation functions are written as the [[Covariance|covariance]]. Assuming $\langle A \rangle = \langle B \rangle = 0$ this is practically a time average of the two observables.

In a stationary state only the time differences are important then we can write the time-correlation as
$$ 
    C_{AB}(t) = \langle A(0)B(t) \rangle
$$

If we want to calculate the time-correlation of an observable with itself then this become the autocorrelation function. This becomes
$$ 
    \widehat{C}_A(t) = \frac{ \langle A(0)A(t) \rangle }{\langle A^2 \rangle}
$$
Furthermore in a stationary state the autocorrelation function is symmetric.
