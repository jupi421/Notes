# Molecular Dynamics

Molecular Dynamics is a simulation technique to study classical many body systems. Quantum effects affect only light atoms/molecules ($H_2$, $D_2$, $He$).

In contrast to the [[Monte-Carlo|Monte Carlo method]] the simulation follows the "natural" path of the particles as they're described by the [[Equations-of-Motion|EOM]], whereas in Monte Carlo the positions of the particles are updated by a fixed steplength and probability.
This enables MD to also provide data about the dynamics of the system (momenta, time evolution) but also to study systems in non-equilibrium.
