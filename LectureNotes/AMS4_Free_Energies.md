# AMS3_Free_Energies

### How are [[Zettelkasten/Free_Energie|free energies]] connected to probabilities?

### How does splitting $Q_{NVT}$ into $Q^{(id)}$ and $Q^{(ex)}$ affect $F(N,V,T)$?

### Why does adding a constant to the free energy not affect the free energy?

### Diagramm of config space

### Coexistance in context of $P_A/P_B$ has to be 1 -> free energy?

### Is a 2nd order phase transition sharp?

### Why doesn't T play a role in the hard sphare system (purely entropic system)?
