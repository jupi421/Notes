# AMS6 Free Energies

### Why can you transform collective variables?

### What does the graph from the lecture notes say?

### Can we exploit the squishing factor to simplify a complex  energy landscape and then transform back again?

### How can we write the free nergy as an ensemble average?

### What is the problem with exponential averaging?
